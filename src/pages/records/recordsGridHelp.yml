gridFields:
  Currency: The "Currency" field from the csv file.
  Type: The "Type" field form the csv file, we only care about records of type "EXCHANGE".
  Amount: The Amount field from the csv file.
  Date: A shorter version of the "Start Date" from the csv file, without the time.
  Fee: | 
    The "Fee" field from the csv file. 
    Caution in older statements the fee was in the cryptocurrency of the record, whereas in more recent statements the fee is in the "Base Currency",
    Both are handled by the RevoGain App, but this can be confusing.
  Balance: The "Balance" field from the csv file.

  Started Date: The "Started Date" field from the csv file.
  Completed Date: |
    The "Completed Date" field from the csv file.
    For exchanges the "Completed Date" is always the same as the "Started Date", so the app only uses the "Start Date".
